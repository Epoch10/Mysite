            I am a 44 years young guitarist/keyboardist, sound engineer, and composer/producer. First playing live regularly at age 16.
            I am an accomplished player and tutor, both live and in the studio.

            Instruments include the guitar to which I studied at ACM Guildford, I'm self taught on keyboards/organ/piano and C&G trained in sound engineering.
            Prestigious gigs include the time 'with a band', I had the opportunity and the pleasure to support and play alongside members of the local band 'The Troggs', famous for
             their many songs including the hits - 'Wild thing' and 'Love is all around'. 
            Previous band projects include Konan, Eezey Money, The Del Newman band, The Greg Winters duo + collaborations etc.
            I have proudly played venues ranging from the 'smaller side of tiny', to the theaters and large summer festivals.
            Currently, I am guitarist/keyboard player in the cool band Sleepwalker. Please do check us out. 
            I'm privately tutoring from my home address in Andover. Use the form below to contact me.
